== acts as hierarchy

This plugin is a replacement for acts_as_nested_set which comes
prepackaged with Rails.

I based the development on the acts_as_threaded plugin, which can be found here:
http://www.railtie.net/articles/2006/02/05/rails-acts_as_threaded-plugin

However, numerous changes and additions to the original code have been
made.

The development was done during a consulting engagement at AutoScout24
Germany (www.autoscout24.de). AutoScout24 has kindly permitted me to
release this code under an Open Source License.
